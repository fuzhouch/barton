# Barton
Barton is a library that provides a set of utility functions to develop
web APIs in Go quickly. It does its job by providing a set of
pre-configured functionalities:

- API engine from [Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo).
- Logger based on [Zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog).
- Prometheus integration.

I plan to add more needed functionalities here.
